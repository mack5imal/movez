# Decisions

Where movez departs from, or resolves an ambiguity in, the product brief, the scheduler research
and the design handoff. Each entry says what was decided and why, so a future change can be made
knowingly rather than by accident.

Sources of truth, in order: `product-brief-v1.md`, `scheduler-research-v1.md`,
`movement-library-v4.json`, `design_handoff_movez_ui/`.

## Build and shape

1. **Xcode project generated from `project.yml` via XcodeGen.** The generated `movez.xcodeproj`
   is committed so the repo opens in Xcode without the tool installed, but `project.yml` is the
   source of truth. Swift language mode 5 with strict concurrency at `targeted`; everything that
   touches state or UI is `@MainActor`.
2. **The library JSON is loaded from the repository root as a bundle resource.** There is no
   second copy to keep in sync, and no movement is hard-coded anywhere in the app.
3. **The app is an `LSUIElement` agent and is unsandboxed.** It reads the frontmost window's
   bounds, the running process list and the microphone's *is-running* property, none of which the
   sandbox permits. It makes no network calls and writes only to its own Application Support
   directory.

## The break

4. **The end-of-break streak chip stays.** A streak is consecutive completed full breaks today;
   a skip resets it, a snooze does not, and a credited absence of five minutes or more counts as
   completed.
5. **The overlay has Next and no Back.** → and Return advance; Escape deliberately does nothing,
   because snoozing should be easier than skipping and neither should happen by reflex.
6. **The sequence strip has as many columns as the routine has blocks** (three to five), not a
   fixed four.
7. **Other displays show the dim and a small label**, not a second copy of the card.
8. **A deferred break is never shortened.** It waits, at full length. What it loses is patience:
   a break that has waited more than half an hour gets one snooze instead of two.

## The micro-break

9. **The thirty-second count-in stays**, with Start now · Snooze 5 min · Skip, then a sixty-second
   countdown with Snooze 5 min · Skip.
10. **One snooze total.** A second snooze request is a skip — the intent is the same and the
    pretence helps nobody.
11. **The handoff's "Shoulder rolls" is placeholder copy.** There is no such movement in the
    library; the fixtures use CIR-06 "Arm circles", which produces the same eyebrow the handoff
    draws, and the substitution is recorded in `SnapshotFixtures`.

## Settings

12. **Equipment chips follow the data, not the handoff.** Band · Kettlebell or dumbbell · Roller ·
    Ball, mapping to `band`, `kettlebell_or_dumbbell`, `foam_roller`, `ball`. The handoff drew
    Kettlebell and Dumbbell as separate chips; the library has one key for both.
13. **The custom preset is a stepper**, 15–120 minutes in fives. The micro-break toggle is hidden
    below 40 minutes, because a bout that short is already under the threshold a micro-break
    exists to break up.
14. **Working hours are one window a day** with a per-day switch, and cannot cross midnight. The
    summary collapses consecutive days that share a window.
15. **The settings sheets are drawn inside the window**, not as system sheets, so every pixel is
    in the app's palette and each one can be rendered offscreen for review.

## The menu bar

16. **"Start a session now" off hours means an ad-hoc session**: a fresh sitting interval, ending
    at "End session", midnight, or a four-hour gap. During one, "End session" replaces "Pause for".
17. **"Take a break now" stays available while paused**, in text-3 rather than removed; clicking
    it ends the pause and starts the break.
18. **The pause glyph rides in the menu-bar text, not in the icon.** The handoff's menu bar reads
    "◌ ‖ 42m"; drawing the glyph in both places stutters.
19. **The dropdown expands rows inline.** A window-style `MenuBarExtra` has no submenus.

## Scheduling

20. **Defer, never reset.** A break that comes due during a call, a screen share or a fullscreen
    app waits; the countdown keeps running underneath it.
20a. **Midnight rolls the counters, not the countdown.** A sitting bout that crosses the day
    boundary keeps its start time, its due time and its state; only the day-scoped counters, the
    routine seed and the streak key start over. Fifteen minutes from a break at 23:45 is fifteen
    minutes from a break at 00:01, and the alternative — handing back a fresh fifty-five minutes —
    is the one thing a break reminder must never do. This matters most to anyone working across
    midnight, for whom the old behaviour cost a break every night.
20b. **Time movez was not running is moved past, not judged.** The state file records when it was
    written, so a relaunch knows whether it was gone for two minutes or two days. A gap under four
    hours shifts the whole bout forward by its length; four hours or more starts the day over. It
    is never credited as a break: a running app can tell from the idle clock whether the user was
    at the keyboard, and an app that was not running cannot.
21. **Nothing is polled while paused or off hours.** The signal monitors stop outright rather than
    sampling into a void; a thirty-second wake-check notices when the pause runs out.
22. **A break counts as done at half the movements or half the time** (research §4.11).
23. **Idle is credited in two tiers**: three to five minutes hands the countdown back with the
    time it had left; five minutes or more is a full break. Both are reversible for six seconds,
    because movez cannot tell a walk to the kitchen from a long read on paper.
24. **Settings apply live.** The scheduler re-plans from the bout that is already running, so
    changing a preset never costs the user the time they have already sat.

## Known compromises

25. **Screen-capture detection is a heuristic.** macOS exposes no public API for "my screen is
    being recorded", so movez watches for the tools people actually use, conservatively: a false
    positive quietly postpones a break, which is better than interrupting a live share. Tools that
    idle in the menu bar all day (Loom, CleanShot X, Kap) are listed but disabled.
26. **Focus is read through a Focus Filter, not the system.** There is no supported way to read
    the current Focus, so movez ships a `SetFocusFilterIntent` the user adds to their own Focus.
27. **Launch at login needs a signed build.** `SMAppService` can refuse on an ad-hoc-signed Debug
    build; the refusal is shown under the toggle rather than letting it spring back silently.
